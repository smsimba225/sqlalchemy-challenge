# sqlalchemy-challenge

This week's challenge was an eye-opening exercise into blending SQL and Python together.  

Using SQL Alchemy to query specific groups of data was very simple, even utilizing the func. module to calculate min, max, sums and averages.  I also really enjoyed being able to take the data and incorporating it into a Pandas DataFrame.  From there it was easy to adjust and plot into various diagrams.

The second part of this homework was particularly mindblowing.  Using Flask we were able to run queries in a simple web-application, essentially creating an API for a user to utilize to gather data.  It was also interesting to learn how HTML code could be incorporated into Python to change the design of the web interface.  

It is very exciting to see everything we have been learning come together, even learning how to iterate through the queries and appending the results needed into a dictionary incorporated many skills we had learned over the last many weeks.

Thank you for looking at my work!
